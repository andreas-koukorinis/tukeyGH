tukeyGH 
=======

The purpose of this package is to provide the basic probablity functions
for Tukey's g-and-h transformation. And also provide a function that esitimates
the g-and-h parameters for a given sample (or theoretical distribution). 

The package includes:

1. `rgh` Generate a random sample from g-and-h
2. `qgh` Compute the quantiles for a given g-and-h distribution
3. `pgh` Compute the distribution for a given g-and-h distribution
4. `dgh` Compute the density for a given g-and-h distribution
5. `qfit` Esitimate g and h via quantile method
